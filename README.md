Tensor total variation deconvolution package uses a tensor total variation to robustly estimate the perfusion parameters in low-dose, low sampling rate CT perfusion with delay in tracer arrival time. In this package, we estimate the perfusion parameter cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT), as described in the following papers.

TTV_FCSA: Core TTV algorithm implementation.
denoise_TTV: Solver for tensor total variation.


INSTALLATION: 
--------------------------
1.  Unzip the package. 
2.  Run Main_TTV.m. This file executes TTV algorithm and compares with sSVD, bSVD and Tikhonov algorithms on a clinical CTP dataset.
3.  For figures in the above mentioned papers, run Exp*.m files which indicated the Figure number in its headline.
4.  SPD comparison is included in all Exp*.m files. To execute SPD algorithm, follow the step below:
     (1) Go to toolbox/SPD_matlab v1.0/Utilities/, compile two packages: ompbox10 and spams-matlab. The binaries for Mac OS 10.9 is already included in the package. For different platforms and OS, 
   a. Go to ompbox10 folder, follow the readme.txt file to make files in MATLAB.
   b. Go to spams-matlab folder and compile following the instructions in HOW_TO_INSTALL.txt. 
   * Note that for newer version of Mac OS (10.7+) or gcc (XCode), issues may arise when running compile.m. Please follow the notes at the end of this README file for possible solutions.
   * If you encounter problems in compiling SPD package, you could refer to README.txt in SPD_matlab v1.0 folder. Or you can comment out all SPD related experiments in the Exp*.m files.
5. You may change the tube current-exposure time product (mAs) and sampling rate in Main_TTV.m, Exp_Clinical.m and other Exp*.m files. You may also use your own simulated or real low-dose image by loading different DICOM or MAT files as Vn (the low-dose CTP data [T x X x Y]).
